        <p>My name is Ashley Young, and this is my travel portfolio! It is a collection of a few trips I have been on, and some of the experiences I've had. 
    I have always loved traveling, and there's a lot more places I plan to visit in the future. 
    I am super grateful for all the places that I have already been, and can't wait to see more.
    I hope that it inspires you to travel and create your own portfolio to record the experiences you have.

    <div class="idea"><ol>Reasons I love to travel:
            <li>Relaxation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Taking a break from the busyness of life is one of the best reasons to travel. It gives you the chance to take time for yourself.</li>
                    <li>It is also really rejuvinating, as you start to see the world in a new perspective.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Appreciation for life</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Experiencing new landscapes and environments helps you to see the beauty and diversity of the earth.</li>
                    <li>It rekindles your sense of wonder and curiosity.</li>
                    <li>Immersing yourself in different ways of life can help you realize the value in connection and community.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Education</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Traveling exposes you to cultures, landscapes, people, and histories beyond what you can learn in a textbook.</li>
                    <li>You experience something unfamiliar and come away with new understanding and appreciation.</li>
                </ul>

    <h2>Costa Rica</h2>
    <img src="../../gaskin/img/IMG_0926.jpg" alt="picture of me in costa rica" width="30%">
    <p>I went to Costa Rica for my graduation trip in the Summer of 2023. It was a Humanitarian Trip (HXP), where me and a group of 13 other kids my age went and built a school for kids who lived in Costa Rica. It was a super cool experience where we got to meet the locals, experience how they lived, try their native foods, and explore the country. We were there for 2 weeks, and the majority of the time we were building the school, but we also got to experience a lot of cool tourist attractions too. My favorites were river rafting, swimming in waterfalls, crocodile tours, and learning how to make Costa Rican tacos. </p>
<br>
    <h2>Dominican Republic</h2>
    <img src="../../gaskin/img/IMG_2266.jpg" alt="photo of me and my family in the Dominican Republic" width="25%">
    <p>I went to the Dominican Republic with my family during the Summer of 2022. This was where my brother served his mission, and we went back to visit the areas he served in. We stayed in a resort right on the beach, and got to swim in the ocean and in the pool everyday. One really cool thing we did was a waterfall tour where we got to cliff-jump, swim in the river, and slide down waterfalls. We also went up the teleferico, which was a cable car that took us up this mountain, and we got to see a really pretty view. The people in the Dominican Republic were really friendly, and it was cool to see the difference between their culture and ours. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Hawaii</h2>
    <img src="../../assets/img/IMG_7482.jpg" alt="picture of me in hawaii" width="25%">
    <p>Me and my family love Hawaii! I’ve been there 4 times, and it’s probably my favorite vacation spot. Two of the times we’ve been there have been on a cruise, where we got to visit all the islands. This last time we went in the summer of 2023, and we stayed in Oahu. I love the beach and all of the fun memories I have with Hawaii.
    </p>
<br>
<h2>More to come!</h2>
<p>These are just a few of the trips I have been on, but I am excited to continue to travel in the future. Right now me and my family are planning to go on a trip to Japan on 4/25/2024. It's coming up super soon, and I can't wait! I also will be leaving on a mission on 5/27/2024 to the Dominican Republic! I could not be more excited, and am so grateful I have already been there so I know a little bit of what to expect.</p>

<p>If you tap on the image above, it takes you to a tableau viz design created by Katie Kilroy. She also loves to travel and created this viz to keep track of all the destinations she has been to! I love looking at the places other people have been as it inspires me to want to see new places too. Here is the link as well:

<p>This video speaks to the larger human experience of travel. We don't just go to places to see them but we go to FEEL them, and experience what living really is. This earth is such an amazing, beautiful, and diverse place. We can't understand it unless we experience it, and truly live in it everyday. No matter where we are. The earth has been on a journey that led it to where it is today, and so have we. I think it's so important to see the value in the world and in each individual. Each person is on a unique path, and by learning more about new cultures, places, and people we start to gain a deeper appreciation of life. </p>
