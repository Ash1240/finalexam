        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a Freshman at Brigham Young University (BYU), in my second semester. I am majoring in business and am thinking about going into Accounting. I am from Murray Utah, and went to Cottonwood High School. I am passionate about traveling, being outdoors, exercising, and spending time with friends and family. My favorite hobbies are tennis, pickleball, walking, painting, and shopping. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and will be going on a mission to the Dominican Republic on May 27th, 2024. I love serving others and learning, and canâ€™t wait for my mission and to complete my schooling when I return. .</p>
